# DeepDive

## Overview

Welcome to the **deepDive** repository! This repository is focused on solving Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems and tackling system design challenges to help prepare for technical interviews. Whether you're aiming for positions in software engineering, data science, or system design roles, this repository offers a deep dive into common interview topics and techniques.

## Contents

- **DSA Problems**: A collection of frequently asked Data Structures and Algorithms problems from various sources (LeetCode, Algomonster, etc.). Each problem includes:
    - Problem description
    - Solution in java
    - Explanation of the approach
    - Time and space complexity analysis

- **System Design**: Insights into system design concepts and best practices. These sections include:
    - Commonly asked system design questions
    - High-level and low-level design discussions
    - Diagrams to illustrate architectural patterns
    - Trade-offs between various approaches

## How to Use

1. **DSA Questions**: Navigate through the folders containing specific topics such as arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, and more. Each topic contains well-documented solutions for relevant problems.
2. **System Design**: Explore different case studies, including real-world examples, to understand how to build scalable and efficient systems.
3. **Interview Prep**: Review curated lists of common interview questions, solutions, and tips for coding interviews and system design interviews.
